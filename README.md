# APITest
Creating a Test Automation Framework using Maven, TestNG, RestAssured and Log4j to test functions in Team City via API. 
This served as a learning experience for me. Current tests include:

  getServer: Returns information about the Team City Server running
  
  getProjects: Returns the list of Projects saved on the Team City server
  
  createNewUser: Registers a new user on to the server
  
  deleteNewUser: Removes a (newly-added) user from the server
